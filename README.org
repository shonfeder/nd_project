deduction (n.)

early 15c., /deduccioun/, "a bringing, a leading;" mid-15c., "action of
deducting; a taking away, a number or amount subtracted," from Old French
deduction (Modern French /déduction/) and directly from Latin /deductionem/
(nominative deductio) "a leading away, an escorting; a diminution," noun of
action from past-participle stem of /deducere/ "lead or bring away or down;
derive" (in Medieval Latin, "infer logically"), from /de/ "down" (see de-) +
/ducere/ "to lead," from PIE root /*deuk-/ "to lead."

Meaning "that which is deducted" is from 1540s. As a term in logic, "derivation
as a result from a known principle, an inference, conclusion," 1520s, from Late
Latin use of /deductio/ as a loan-translation of Greek /apagoge/. Related:
Deductional.
